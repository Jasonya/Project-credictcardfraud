# Project-credictcardfraud

The dataset is from "redit Card Fraud Detection", Kaggle

The Project includes two parts:
1. Transactions_estimator:
    Three different machine learning models (isolationforest, randomforest, multiple-layered perceptron) have been built to predict the fraud/valid transactions 
    with the imbalance dataset. The accuracy score, precision score... matrices are used to compared the model performance.
    
2. Dealing_with_Imbalance_Data:
    Five different methods of dealing with imbalanced data are performed, including change performance metric, change the algorithm, oversampling, downsampling, and 
    generate synthetic sampling using SMOTE.
